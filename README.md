# FWD HTML Project
This is an FWD HTML project.

# how to run
* `npm install`
* `npx gulp`

After doing this, you should be piped with a live server, and it will watch all of your changes in the html and sass file and compiled it in styles/css.

Notes: if you download from project folder, there is a gulpfile.js, which does not work, has something to do with ES Module. So just delete that file and use mjs file.(source code file containing an ES Module (ECMAScript Module) for use with a Node.js application)

And there is a conflict file, which can also be deleted.
